## STRATEGIC INSIGHTS FROM ANALYST Q&A

### 🟢 Positive Signals

**AI/Datacenter Acceleration**
- Management noted HBM3E is "significantly supply constrained" with demand exceeding supply through CY25
- Secured design wins at all major hyperscalers for HBM3E 12-high and 16-high configurations
- Data center bit demand grew 30%+ QoQ; AI servers now representing 15-20% of data center revenue (up from 10%)

**Technology Leadership**
- Announced sampling of HBM4 in H2 CY25, maintaining parity with SK Hynix timeline
- 1β DRAM node ramping faster than planned; crossing 25% of DRAM output in Q3
- DDR5 now 55% of data center DRAM mix (industry leading penetration)

**Pricing Power in Premium Segments**
- HBM ASPs up 20%+ sequentially; management commented pricing "remains healthy"
- Enterprise SSD pricing improved mid-single digits despite broader NAND weakness
- No signs of pricing aggression from competitors in high-end segments

### 🔴 Negative Signals

**Consumer Market Deterioration**
- PC DRAM demand "significantly below seasonal" with OEMs working through excess inventory
- Mobile DRAM revenue down mid-single digits QoQ; China smartphone demand "disappointing"
- Consumer SSD market oversupplied; ASPs declining despite bit growth

**NAND Concerns Emerging**
- First ASP decline in NAND in 6 quarters (-1% QoQ)
- Management acknowledged "heightened competition" in NAND, code for price pressure
- Data center SSD inventory building at some cloud customers; Q3 orders may be lumpy

**CapEx Signal**
- Maintained $10-11B FY25 CapEx (unchanged) despite raising revenue guidance
- Suggests caution about cycle sustainability or deliberate supply discipline
- CFO noted "monitoring closely" - risk of CapEx increase if HBM demand sustains

### ⚠️ Watch Signals

**HBM Capacity Race**
- Management deflected questions about HBM market share relative to Samsung/SK Hynix
- Emphasized "we're capacity constrained, not competitively disadvantaged" - defensive tone
- Industry estimates: SK Hynix 50%+ share, Samsung 30%, Micron <20% (source: TrendForce)

**China Exposure**
- 11% of revenue from China (down from 25% pre-sanctions)
- No near-term sanctions impact mentioned, but geopolitical tail risk remains

**Guidance Conservatism**
- Q3 revenue guide $9.2-9.6B at midpoint suggests only +3% QoQ growth
- Below typical seasonal (+5-7%); may be sandbagging or reflects consumer softness

## SO WHAT FOR SK HYNIX

### Market Conditions
✓ **Memory recovery validated**: Micron's strong results confirm industry upcycle is real and broadening beyond AI  
✓ **Pricing stabilizing**: DRAM ASP growth slowing suggests market reaching equilibrium; less upside risk to margins  
⚠️ **NAND warning sign**: First ASP decline in 6 quarters signals NAND may peak sooner than DRAM

### Competitive Threats from Micron
❗ **HBM momentum building**: Micron's HBM revenue doubling QoQ + hyperscaler wins threaten SK Hynix's dominant 50%+ market share  
❗ **Technology parity**: HBM4 sampling timeline matches SK Hynix; losing technology leadership gap that drove share gains  
✓ **But still lagging capacity**: Micron acknowledged supply constraints; SK Hynix maintains 6-9 month capacity advantage

### Competitive Opportunities
✓ **Consumer weakness**: Micron's PC/mobile struggles create opportunity for SK Hynix volume share gains in Q2-Q3  
✓ **NAND vulnerability**: Micron's NAND ASP decline suggests pricing pressure; SK Hynix + Samsung may force further cuts  
✓ **CapEx discipline**: Micron's flat CapEx signals SK Hynix can maintain rational supply growth without triggering arms race

### Technology Positioning
✓ **SK Hynix leads HBM**: ~50% market share vs. Micron's ~20%; customers value SK Hynix's 8H/12H proven track record  
⚠️ **Narrowing gap**: Micron's 1β DRAM ramp + HBM3E wins show they're catching up faster than expected  
✓ **DDR5 advantage fading**: Micron's 55% DDR5 mix comparable to SK Hynix's ~60%; differentiation weakening

### Strategic Implications for SK Hynix
1. **Protect HBM share aggressively**: Accelerate HBM3E 16-high production; lock in 2026 capacity commitments with hyperscalers before Micron scales
2. **Consider tactical NAND pricing**: Use Micron's NAND weakness to gain SSD market share; force further ASP declines
3. **Maintain CapEx flexibility**: Micron's discipline signals room to increase CapEx if HBM demand sustains without triggering oversupply
4. **Watch Q3 guidance closely**: If Micron's Q3 comes in weak, validates concerns about consumer drag on overall market

### Pricing & Demand Trends Affecting SK Hynix
- **HBM pricing**: Remains robust (+20% QoQ); SK Hynix can maintain premium pricing through 2025
- **DRAM ASP outlook**: Slowing growth (+3% vs. +8%) suggests SK Hynix should plan for flattish ASPs in H2 FY25
- **NAND risk**: First decline in 6 quarters; SK Hynix should prepare for NAND margin pressure in Q3-Q4
- **Volume opportunity**: Micron's consumer weakness = SK Hynix can take bit share in PC/mobile without price cuts

---

## RECOMMENDED ACTIONS

1. **Competitive Intelligence**: Request deep dive on Micron's HBM3E capacity roadmap and customer commitments
2. **Strategic Planning**: Model scenario where Micron reaches 25-30% HBM share by 2026; implications for SK Hynix margins
3. **Sales Enablement**: Brief hyperscaler account teams on Micron's Q2 wins; reinforce SK Hynix's technology + capacity advantages
4. **Supply Chain**: Evaluate accelerating 1γ DRAM node ramp to maintain cost leadership vs. Micron's 1β progress
